# Voicemeeter Proxy
Companion interacts with the Voicemeeter API by searching for the install location and then binding to a .dll file used by Voicemeeter for external remote control, but because of this it means that if you wish to control Voicemeeter on a machine other than the one running Companion you will need to use a proxy running on the machine running Voicemeeter.


## Prereuisuites
NodeJS >= 18

## Steps
1. Download the [companion-module-vbaudio-voicemeeter repository](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-vbaudio-voicemeeter). This can be done either by `git clone` or by clicking on the Code button, and then downloading the zip
2. Install NodeJS version from prereuisuites (https://nodejs.org/en#download)
3. In the directory you've cloned or unzipped the repo to, run `npm i`. This will download the modules dependencies
4. Run `node proxy` to start running the proxy on the default port of 8099, or use the `-p PORT` argument to specify a port, such as `node proxy -p 3000`
5. In Companion, create an instance for Voicemeeter and in the configuration set the IP and Port of where the proxy is running
